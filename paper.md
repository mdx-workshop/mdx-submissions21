# Abstract

Source separation models either work on the spectrogram or waveform domain.
In this work, we show how to perform end-to-end hybrid source separation,
letting the model decide which domain is best suited for each source, and even combining
both. The proposed hybrid version of the Demucs architecture [@demucs]
won the Music Demixing Challenge 2021 organized by Sony.
This architecture also comes with additional improvements, such as compressed residual branches,
local attention or singular value regularization.
Overall, a 1.4 dB improvement of the Signal-To-Distortion (SDR) was observed across all sources
as measured on the MusDB HQ dataset [@musdbhq],
an improvement confirmed by human subjective evaluation, with an overall quality
rated at 2.83 out of 5 (2.36 for the non hybrid Demucs), and absence of contamination at 3.04 (against 2.37 for the non hybrid Demucs and 2.44
for the second ranking model submitted at the competition).


# Introduction

Work on music source separation has recently focused on the task of
separating 4 well defined instruments in a supervised manner:
drums, bass, vocals and other accompaniments.
Recent evaluation campaigns  [@sisec] have focused on this setting,
relying on the standard MusDB benchmark [@musdb].
In 2021, Sony organized the Music Demixing Challenge (MDX) [@mdx], an online competition
where separation models are evaluated on a completely new and hidden test set composed of
27 tracks.

The challenge featured a number of baselines to start from, which could be divided
into two categories: spectrogram or waveform based methods.
The former consists in models that are fed with the input spectrogram,
either represented by its amplitude, such as Open-Unmix [@umx] and its variant
CrossNet Open-Unmix [@xumx], or as the concatenation of its real and imaginary part, a.k.a Complex-As-Channels (CAC) [@cac], such as LaSAFT [@lasaft].
Similarly, the output can be either a mask on the input spectrogram, complex modulation of the input spectrogram [@kong2021decoupling], or the CAC representation.

On the other hand, waveform based models such as Demucs [@demucs] are directly
fed with the raw waveform, and output the raw waveform for each of the source.
Most of those methods will perform some kind of learnt time-frequency analysis in its
first layers through convolutions, such as Demucs and Conv-TasNet [@convtasnet], although some will not rely
at all on convolutional layers, like Dual-Path RNN [@dual_path].

Theoretically, there should be no difference
between spectrogram and waveform models, in particular when considering CaC (complex as channels),
which is only a linear change of base for the input and output space.
However, this would only hold true in the limit of having an infinite amount of training data.
With a constrained dataset, such as the 100 songs of MusDB, inductive bias can play an important role.
In particular, spectrogram methods varies by more than their input and output space.
For instance, with a notion of frequency, it is possible to apply convolutions along frequencies,
while waveform methods must use layers that are fully connected with respect to their channels.
The final test loss being far from zero, there will also be artifacts in the separated audio.
Different representations will lead to different artifacts, some being more noticeable
for the drums and bass (phase inconsitency for spectrogram methods will make the attack sounds hollow),
while others are more noticeable for the vocals (vocals separated by Demucs suffer from crunchy static noise)

In this work, we extend the Demucs architecture to perform hybrid waveform/spectrogram
domain source separation. The original U-Net architecture [@unet] is extended to provide two parallel branches:
one in the time (temporal) and one in the frequency (spectral) domain.
We bring other improvements to the architecture, namely compressed residual branches
comprising dilated convolutions [@dilated], LSTM [@lstm] and attention [@attention] with a focus on local content.
We measure the impact of those changes on the MusDB benchmark and on the MDX
hidden test set, as well as subjective evaluations.
Hybrid Demucs ranked 1st at the MDX competition when trained only on MusDB, with 7.32 dB of SDR, and 2nd with extra training
data allowed.

# Related work

There exist a number of spectrogram based music source separation architectures.
Open-Unmix [@umx] is based on fully connected layers and a bi-LSTM. It uses multi-channel Wiener filtering
[@wiener] to reduce artifacts. While the original Open-Unmix is trained independently on each source,
a multi-target version exists [@xumx], through a shared averaged representation layer.
D3Net [@d3net] is another architecture, based on dilated convolutions connected with dense skip connections.
It was before the competition the best performing spectrogram architecture, with an average SDR of 6.0 dB on MusDB.
Unlike previous methods which are based on masking,
LaSAFT [@lasaft] uses Complex-As-Channels [@cac] along with a U-Net [@unet] architecture.
It is also single-target, however its weights are shared across targets, using
a weight modulation mechanism to select a specific source.

Waveform domain source separation was first explored by [@wavenet],
as well as [@waveunet_singing] and [@waveunet] with Wave-U-Net.
However, those methods were lagging in term of quality,
almost 2 dB behind their spectrogram based competitors.
Demucs [@demucs] was built upon Wave-U-Net, using faster strided convolutions rather
than explicit downsampling, allowing for a much larger number of channels, but potentially introducing aliasing artifacts [@pons2021upsampling], and
extra Gated Linear Unit layers [@glu] and biLSTM.
For the first time, waveform domain methods surpassed spectrogram ones when considering
the overall SDR (6.3 dB on MusDB), although its performance is still inferior
on the other and vocals sources.
Conv-Tasnet [@convtasnet], a model based on masking over a learnt time-frequency representation
using dilated convolutions, was also adapted to music source separation by [@demucs],
but suffered from more artifacts and lower SDR.

To the best of our knowledge, no other work has studied true end-to-end hybrid source separation,
although other teams in the MDX competition used model blending from different domains as a simpler post-training alternative.


# Architecture

In this Section we present the structure of Hybrid Demucs, as well
as the other additions that were added to the original Demucs architecture.

## Original Demucs

The original Demucs architecture [@demucs] is a U-Net [@unet] encoder/decoder structure.
A BiLSTM [@lstm] is applied between the encoder and decoder to provide long range context.
The encoder and decoder have a symetric structure. Each encoder layer is composed
of a convolution with a kernel size of 8, stride of 4 and doubling the number of channels (except for
the first layer, which sets it to a fix value, typically 48 or 64). It is followed by a ReLU,
and a so called 1x1 convolution with Gated Linear Unit activation [@glu], i.e. a convolution
with a kernel size of 1, where the first half of the channels modulates the second half through a sigmoid.
The 1x1 convolution double the channels, and the GLU halves them, keeping them constant overall.
Symetrically, a decoder layer sums the contribution from the U-Net skip connection and the previous layer,
apply a 1x1 convolution with GLU, then a transposed convolution that halves the number of channels (except for the outermost layer),
with a kernel size of 8 and stride of 4, and a ReLU (except for the outermost layer).
There are 6 encoder layers, and 6 decoder layers, for processing 44.1 kHz audio.
In order to limit the impact of aliasing from the outermost layers, the input audio is upsampled by a factor of 2 before
entering the encoder, and downsampled by a factor of 2 when leaving the decoder.

## Hybrid Demucs

### Overall architecture

Hybrid Demucs extends the original architecture with multi-domain analysis and prediction
capabilities.
The model is composed of a temporal branch, a spectral branch, and shared layers.
The temporal branch takes the input waveform and process it like the standard Demucs.
It contains 5 layers, which are going to reduce the number of time steps by a factor of $4^5 = 1024$.
Compared with the original architecture, all ReLU activations are replaced by
Gaussian Error Linear Units (GELU) [@gelu].

The spectral branch takes the spectrogram obtained from a STFT over 4096 time steps,
with a hop length of 1024. Notice that the number of time steps immediately matches
that of the output of the encoder of the temporal branch. In order to reduce the frequency dimension,
we apply the same convolutions as in the temporal branch, but along the frequency dimension.
Each layer reduces by a factor of 4 the number of frequencies, except for the 5th layer,
which reduces by a factor of 8. After being processed by the spectral encoder,
the signal has only one "frequency" left, and the same number of channels and sample rate
as the output of the temporal branch.
The temporal and spectral representations are then summed before going through a shared encoder/decoder
layer which further reduces by 2 the number of time steps (using a kernel size of 4).
Its output serves both as the input of the temporal and spectral decoder.
Hybrid Demucs has a dual U-Net structure, with the temporal and spectral branches having
their respective skip connections.

The output of the spectral branch is inversed with the ISTFT, and summed with the
temporal branch output, giving the final model prediction. Due to this overall design,
the model is free to use whichever representation is most conveniant for different parts of the signal,
even within one source, and can freely share information between the two representations.
The hybrid architecture is represented on \autoref{fig:hyb}.

### Padding for easy alignment

One difficulty was to properly align the spectral
and temporal representations for any input length.
For an input length $L$, kernel size $K$, stride $S$ and padding on each side $P$, the output of a convolution
is of length $(L - K + 2 * P) / S + 1$. Following the practice from models like MelGAN [@melgan]
we pad by $P = (K - S) / 2$, giving an output of
$L / S$, so that matching the overall stride is now sufficiant to exactly match the length
of the spectral and temporal representations. We apply this padding both for the STFT,
and convolution layers in the temporal encoders.

![Hybrid Demucs architecture. The input waveform is processed
both through a temporal encoder, and first through the STFT followed by
a spectral encoder. The two representations are summed when their dimensions align.
The decoder is built symmetrically. The output spectrogram go through the ISTFT
and is summed with the waveform outputs, giving the final model output.
The $\mathrm{Z}$ prefix is used for spectral layers, and $\mathrm{T}$ prefix for the
temporal ones.](figures/hybrid.pdf){width=80%, #fig:hyb}



### Frequency-wise convolutions

In the spectral branch, we use frequency-wise convolutions, dividing the number of frequency bins by 4 with every layer.
For simplicity we drop the highest bin, giving 2048
frequency bins after the STFT. The input of the 5th layer has 8 frequency bins, which we reduce to 1 with
a convolution with a kernel size of 8 and no padding.
It has been noted that unlike the time axis, the distribution of musical signals
is not truely invariant to translation along the frequency axis. Instruments have specific
pitch range, vocals have well defined formants etc.
To account for that, [@zemb] suggest injecting an embedding of the frequency before applying
the convolution. We use the same approach, with the addition that we smooth the initial
embedding so that close frequencies have similar embeddings. We inject this embedding just before
the second encoder layer.
We also investigated using specific weights for different frequency bands. This however turned out more complex for a similar result.

### Spectrogram representation

We investigated both with representing the spectrogram as complex numbers [@cac] or
as amplitude spectrograms. For this second option, we use Wiener filtering [@wiener].
We use Open-Unmix differentiable implementation of this filtering [@umx], which uses an iterative
estimation procedure. Using more iterations at evaluation time is usually optimal,
but sadly doesn't work well with the hybrid approach, as changing the spectrogram output,
without the waveform output being able to adapt will drastically reduce the SDR,
and using a high number of iterations at train time is prohibitively slow.
In all cases, we differentiably transform the spectrogram branch output to a waveform,
summed to the waveform branch output, and the final loss is applied in the waveform domain.


## Compressed residual branches

The original Demucs encoder layer is composed of a convolution with kernel size of 8 and stride of 4,
followed by a ReLU, and of a convolution with kernel size of 1 followed by a GLU.
Between those two convolutions, we introduce two compressed residual branches, composed
of dilated convolutions, and for the innermost layers, a biLSTM with limited span and local attention.
Remember that after the first convolution of the 5th layer, the temporal and spectral branches have the same
shape. The 5th layer of each branch actually only contains this convolution, with the compressed
residual branch and 1x1 convolution being shared.

Inside a residual branch, all convolutions are with respect to the time dimension, and
different frequency bins are processed separately.
There are two compressed residual branch per encoder layer.
Both are composed
of a convolution with a kernel size of 3, stride of 1, dilation of 1 for the first branch and 2 for the second, and 4 times less output dimensions than the input,
followed by layer normalization [@layernorm] and a GELU activation.

For the 5th and 6th encoder layers, long range context is processed through a local
attention layer (see definition hereafter) as well as a biLSTM with 2 layers, inserted with a skip connection, and with a maximum span of 200 steps.
In practice, the input is splitted into frames of 200 time steps, with a stride of 100
steps. Each frame is processed concurrently, and for any
time step, the output from the frame for which it is the furthest away from the edge is kept.

Finally, and for all layers, a final convolution with a kernel size of 1
outputs twice as many channels as the input dimension of the residual branch,
followed by a GLU. This output is then summed with the original input,
after having been scaled through a LayerScale layer [@layerscale], with an initial scale of
$1\mathrm{e}{-}3$.
A complete representation of the compressed residual branches is given on \autoref{fig:residual}.


### Local attention

Local attention builds on regular attention [@attention] but replaces positional embedding
by a controllable penalty term that penalizes attending to positions that are far away.
Formally, the attention weights from position $i$ to position $j$ is given by
$$
w_{i, j} = \mathrm{softmax}(Q_i^T K_j - \sum_{k=1}^4 k \beta_{i, k} |i -j|) $$
where $Q_i$ are the queries and $K_j$ are the keys. The values $\beta_{i, k}$
are obtained as the output of a linear layer, initialized so that they are initially very close to 0.
Having multiple $\beta_{i, k}$ with different weights $k$ allows the network
to efficiently reduce its receptive field without requiring $\beta_{i, k}$ to take large values.
In practice, we use a sigmoid activation to derive the values $\beta_{i, k}$.

![Representation of the compressed residual branches
that are added to each encoder layer. For the 5th and 6th layer,
a BiLSTM and a local attention layer are added.](figures/residual.pdf){width=80%, #fig:residual}


## Stabilizing training

We observed that Demucs training could be unstable, especially as we added more layers
and increased the training set size with 150 extra songs.
Loading the model just before its divergence point, we realized that the weights
for the innermost encoder and decoder layers would get very large eigen values.

A first solution is to use group normalization (with 4 groups) just after
the non residual convolutions for the layers 5 and 6 of the encoder and the decoder. Using normalization on all layers deteriorates
performance, but using it only on the innermost layers seems to stabilize training
without hurting performance. Interestingly, when the training is stable (in particular
when trained only on MusDB), using normalization was at best neutral with respect
to the separation score, but never improved it, and considerably slowed down
convergence during the first half of the epochs.
When the training was unstable, using normalization would improve the overall performance
as it allows the model to train for a larger number of epochs.

A second solution we investigated was to use singular value regularization [@spectral].
While previous work used the power method iterative procedure, we obtained better and faster
approximations of the largest singular value using a low rank SVD method [@lowranksvd].
This solution has the advantage of always improving generalization, even when
the training was already stable. Sadly, it was not sufficient on its own to
remove entirely instabilities, but only to reduce them. Another down side
was the longer training time due to the extra low rank SVD evaluation.
In the end, in order to both achieve the best performance and remove entirely
training instabilities, the two solutions were combined.

# Experimental Results

## Datasets

The 2021 MDX challenge [@mdx] offered two tracks: Track A, where only MusDB HQ [@musdbhq]
could be used for training, and Track B, where any data could be used.
MusDB HQ, released under mixed licensing [^1] is composed of 150 tracks, including 86 for the train set, 14 for the valid, and
50 for the test set.
For Track B, we additionally trained using 150 tracks for an internal dataset, and
repurpose the test set of MusDB as training data, keeping only the original validation set
for model selection.
Models are evaluated either through the MDX AI Crowd API[^2], or on the MusDB HQ test set.

### Realistic remix of tracks

We achieved further gains (between 0.1 and 0.2dB) by fine tuning the models on
a specifically crafted dataset, and with longer training samples (30 seconds instead of 10).
This dataset was built by combining stems from separate tracks, while respecting a number of conditions,
in particular beat matching and pitch compatibility.
Note that training from scratch on this dataset led to worse performance, likely because the model could rely
too much on melodic structure, while random remixing forces the model to separate without this information.

We use `librosa` [@librosa] for both beat tracking and tempo estimation, as well as
chromagram estimation.
Beat tracking is applied only on the drum source, while chromagram estimation is applied on the bass line.
We aggregate the chromagram over time to a single chroma distribution
and find the optimal pitch shift between two stems to maximize overlap (as measured by the L1 distance).
We assume that the optimal shift for the bass line is the same for the vocals and accompaniments.
Similarly, we align the tempo and first beat. In order to limit artifacts, we only allow two stems to blend
if they require less than 3 semi-tones of shift and 15% of tempo change.




## Metrics

The MDX challenge introduced a novel Signal-To-Distortion measure.
Another SDR measure existed, as introduced by [@measures]. The advantage of the
new definition is its simplicty and fast evaluation.
The new definition is simply defined as
\begin{equation}
SDR = 10 \log_{10} \frac{\sum_{n} \lVert\mathbf{s}(n)\rVert^2 + \epsilon}{\sum_{n}\lVert\mathbf{s}(n)-\hat{\mathbf{s}}(n)\rVert^2 + \epsilon},
\label{eq:sdr}
\end{equation}
where $s$ is the ground truth source, $\hat{s}$ the estimated source, and $n$
the time index.
In order to reliably compare to previous work, we will refer to this new SDR
definition as *nSDR*, and to the old definition as *SDR*.
Note that when using nSDR on the MDX test set, the metric is defined as the average across all songs.
The evaluation on the MusDB test set follows the traditional median across the songs
of the median over all 1 second segments of each song.

## Models

The model submitted to the competitions were actually bags of 4 models.
For Track A, we had to mix hybrid and non hybrid Demucs models, as the hybrid ones were
having worse performance on the bass source. On Track B, we used only hybrid models,
as the extra training data allowed them to perform better for all sources.
Note that a mix of Hybrid models using CaC or Wiener filtering were used, mostly because it was
too costly to reevaluate all models for the competition. For details on the exact
architecture and hyper-parameter used, we refer the reader to our Github repository [facebookresearch/demucs](https://github.com/facebookresearch/demucs).

For the baselines, we report the numbers from the top participants at the MDX competition [@mdx].
We focus particularly on the KUIELAB-MDX-Net model, which came in second. This model builds
on [@cac] and
combines a pure spectrogram model with the prediction from the original Demucs [@demucs] model
for the drums and bass sources.
When comparing models on MusDB, we also report the numbers for some of the best performing methods
outside of the MDX competition, namely D3Net [@d3net] and ResUNetDecouple+ [@kong2021decoupling],
as well as the original Demucs model [@demucs]. Note that those models were evaluated
on MusDB (not HQ) which lacks the frequency content between 16 kHz and 22kHz.
This can bias the metrics.


## Results on MDX

We provide the results from the top participants at the MDX competition on Table \autoref{tbl:mdx_a}
for the track A (trained on MusDB HQ only) and on Table \autoref{tbl:mdx_b} for track B (any training data).
We also report for track A the metrics for the Demucs architecture improved with
the residual branches, but without the spectrogram branch. The hybrid approach
especially improves the nSDR on the `Other` and `Vocals` source.
Despite this improvement, the Hybrid Demucs model is still performing worse than
the KUIELAB-MDX-Net on those two sources.
On Track B, we notice again that the Hybrid Demucs architecture is very strong on the `Drums` and `Bass`
source, while lagging behind on the `Other` and `Vocals` source.

## Results on MusDB

We show on Table \autoref{tbl:musdb} the SDR metrics  as measured on the MusDB dataset.
Again, Hybrid Demucs achieves the best performance for the `Drums` and `Bass` source,
while improving quite a lot over waveform only Demucs for the `Other` and `Vocals`, but
not enough to surpasse KUIELAB-MDX-Net, which is purely spectrogram based for those two sources.
Interestingly, the best performance on the `Vocals` source is also achieved by ResUNetDecouple+ [@kong2021decoupling],
which uses a novel complex modulation of the input spectrogram.

## Human evaluations

We also performed Mean Opinion Score human evaluations. We re-use the same protocol as in [@demucs]:
we asked human subjects to evaluate a number of samples based on two criteria: the absence of artifacts,
and the absence of bleeding (contamination). Both are evaluated on a scale from 1 to 5, with 5 being the best grade.
Each subject is tasked with evaluating 25 samples of 12 seconds, drawn randomly
from the 50 test set tracks of MusDB. All subjects have a strong experience
with music (amateur and professional musicians, sound engineers etc).
The results are given on Table \autoref{tbl:mos_quality} for the quality,
and \autoref{tbl:mos_bleed} for the bleeding.
We observe strong improvements over the original Demucs, although we observe some regression
on the bass source when considering quality. The model KUIELAb-MDX-Net that came in second
at the MDX competition performs the best on vocals. The Hybrid Demucs architecture
however reduces by a large amount bleeding across all sources.

# Conclusion

We introduced a number of architectural changes to the Demucs architecture that greatly
improved the quality of source separation for music. On the MusDB HQ benchark,
the gain is around 1.4 dB. Those changes include compressed residual branches
with local attention and chunked biLSTM, and most importantly, a novel hybrid spectrogram/temporal
domain U-Net structure, with parallel temporal and spectrogram branches, that merge into a common
core. Those changes allowed to achieve the first rank at the 2021 Sony Music DemiXing challenge,
and translated into strong improvements of the overall quality and absence of bleeding between
sources as measured by human evaluations.
For all its gain, one limitation of our approach is the increased complexity of the U-Net encoder/decoder,
requiring careful alignmement of the temporal and spectral signals through well shaped convolutions.
